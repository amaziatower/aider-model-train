# Agent Runtime

Agent runtime is the execution environment for agents in AGNext.
Similar to the runtime environment of a programming language, the
agent runtime provides the necessary infrastructure to facilitate communication
between agents, manage agent states, and provide API for monitoring and
debugging multi-agent interactions.
