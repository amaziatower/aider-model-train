### TLDR

To help AutoGen devs manage our OSS community, we are adding a new sample app called, Anny-- a simple Discord bot powered by AutoGen.

### Introduction

In just a few months,
incredibly satisfying
but ridicously overwhelming to keep up with community asks

every day process involves manually sifting through issues, PRs, and discussions on GitHub.
Messages (from 2K+ community) on Discord. Any DMs, emails from with colleagues internal and external.

Answering questions
Recognizing and prioritizing bugs and features
Maintaining a responsive for our incredible community
Tracking growth

This takes large amount of effort from incredibly talented people
precious time that could be spent
value added automation
- automate monotonous tasks
- redirect attention to what's most critical
