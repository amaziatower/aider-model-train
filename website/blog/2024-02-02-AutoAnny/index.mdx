### TLDR

To help AutoGen devs manage our OSS community, we are adding a new sample app called, Anny-- a simple Discord bot powered by AutoGen.

### Introduction

Over the past few months, our team has experienced both the satisfaction of growth and the overwhelming task of keeping up with community requests. Our daily process involves manually sifting through issues, PRs, and discussions on GitHub, as well as managing messages from our 2,000+ community members on Discord, not to mention direct messages and emails from colleagues both inside and outside our organization.

Our responsibilities include:
- Answering questions
- Recognizing and prioritizing bugs and features
- Maintaining responsiveness for our incredible community
- Tracking growth


This requires a significant amount of effort from our talented team, and it's time that could be better spent on more value-added tasks. That's why we're turning to automation to handle the more monotonous tasks and allow us to focus on what's most critical.


### Its Not Just for AutoGen
If you're an open-source developer managing your own project, you can probably relate to our challenges. We invite you to check out Anny and contribute to its development. Together, we can make open-source development a smoother, more efficient process for everyone.
