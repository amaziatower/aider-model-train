Most contributions require you to agree to a

If you are new to GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) is a detailed help source on getting involved with development on GitHub.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide

## How to make a good bug report

When you submit an issue to [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/issues), please do your best to
follow these guidelines! This will make it a lot easier to provide you with good
feedback:

- The ideal bug report contains a short reproducible code snippet. This way
  anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) for more details). If your snippet is
  longer than around 50 lines, please link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) or a GitHub repo.

- If an exception is raised, please **provide the full traceback**.

- Please include your **operating system type and version number**, as well as
  your **Python, autogen, scikit-learn versions**. The version of autogen
  can be found by running the following code snippet:
```python
import autogen
print(autogen.__version__)
```

- Please ensure all **code snippets and error messages are formatted in
  appropriate code blocks**.  See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
  for more details.
