    "# Allowing Human Feedback in Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two chapters we introduced the `ConversableAgent` class and showed how you can use it to create autonomous (`human_input_mode=NEVER`) agents that can accomplish tasks. We also showed how to properly terminate a conversation between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "But many applications may require putting humans in-the-loop with agents. For example, to allow human feedback to steer agents in the right direction, specify goals, etc. In this chapter, we will show how AutoGen supports human intervention."

    "## Human Input Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently AutoGen supports three modes for human input. The mode is specified through\n",
    "the `human_input_mode` argument of the `ConversableAgent`. The three modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `NEVER`: human input is never requested.\n",
    "2. `TERMINATE` (default): human input is only requested when a termination condition is\n",
    "    met. Note that in this mode if the human chooses to intercept and reply, the conversation continues\n",
    "    and the counter used by `max_consectuive_auto_reply` is reset.\n",
    "3. `ALWAYS`: human input is always requested and the human can choose to skip and trigger an auto-reply,\n",
    "    intercept and provide feedback, or terminate the conversation. Note that in this mode\n",
    "    termination based on `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapters already showed many examples of the cases when `human_input_mode` is `NEVER`. \n",
    "Below we show one such example again and then show the differences when this mode is set to `ALWAYS` and `NEVER` instead."
