# Tutorial: Video Sufer Agent using AutoGen

In this tutorial you'll learn how to create _video surfer agent_ using AutoGen.
We'll first walk you through how to create your development environment and then we'll extend
built-in agents in AutoGen and adapt them to create a the video sufer.

## What you'll learn

- How to setup and install AutoGen.
- How to use and modify built-in agent provided by AutoGen.
- How to equip an agent with tools.
- How to create a multi-agent team.

## Requirements and resources

You'll need:

- Linux, Mac, or Windows machine with Python 3.10 or above
- An OpenAI API key

While this exercise is designed to be self-sufficient, at any time feel free to consult the [source code](https://aka.ms/autogen-gh) or the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/).

## Install the dependencies

Create a python virtual environment. Please feel free to use a virtual environment manager of your choice (e.g., `venv` or `conda`). Once you have created the virtual environment, please install the `agentchat` package using:

```bash
pip install 'autogen-agentchat==0.4.0.dev8' 'autogen-ext==0.4.0.dev8'
```

This will install the high-level API for agents built using `autogen-core`.

## A hello world example with `AssistantAgent`

Run the script below. You'll need an OpenAI API key.

```python
import asyncio

from autogen_agentchat.task import Console, TextMentionTermination
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient


async def main() -> None:
    """
    Main function to run the video agent.
    """
    # Define an agent
    video_agent = AssistantAgent(
        name="VideoSurferAgent",
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
          model="gpt-4o",
          # api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
          )
        )

    # Define termination condition
    termination = TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE")

    # Define a team
    agent_team = RoundRobinGroupChat([video_agent], termination_condition=termination)

    # Run the team and stream messages to the console
    stream = agent_team.run_stream(task="Hi!")
    await Console(stream)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Note that AutoGen uses the Python async API. Here is a link to [async programming in python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

### Exercise 1: Modify the System Prompt

```python
  ...
  SYSTEM_PROMPT="custom system prompt"
   video_agent = AssistantAgent(
        name="VideoSurferAgent",
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
          model="gpt-4o",
          # api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
          ),
        system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT
        )
  ...
```

### Exercise 2: Add a Given Action

```python

def get_video_length(video_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns the length of the video in seconds.

    :param video_path: Path to the video file.
    :return: Duration of the video in seconds.
    """
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        raise IOError(f"Cannot open video file {video_path}")
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    frame_count = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)
    duration = frame_count / fps
    cap.release()

    return f"The video is {duration:.2f} seconds long."


  ...
  SYSTEM_PROMPT="custom system prompt"
  video_agent = AssistantAgent(
      name="VideoSurferAgent",
      model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
        model="gpt-4o",
        # api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
        ),
      system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      tools=[get_video_length],
   )
  ...

```

### Exercise 3: Add more actions of your choice

```python

def tool1(...)
    ...


def tool2(...)
    ...

    ...
    tools=[get_video_length, tool1, tool2, ...],
    ...
```

You may add any tools of your choice. For example, a tool that allows video surfer to transcribe the audio in the video, or a tool that allows the video surfer to caption the contents of the video a given timestamp. Note that if your tools require new dependecies (e.g., python packages) ensure that you've installed them.

### Exercise 4: Create an agent team

You will now create a multi-agent team consisting of the a user (using the UserProxyAgent) and the MagenticOneGroupChat, a powerful agent that orchestrate other agents and solve tasks by planning and tracking progress via ledgers.

```python
from autogen_agentchat.teams import MagenticOneGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.agents import UserProxyAgent

async def main() -> None:
    """
    Main function to run the video agent.
    """

    # Define an agent
    video_agent = AssistantAgent(
        ...  # your arguments
        )

    web_surfer_agent = UserProxyAgent(
        name="User"
    )

    # Define a team
    agent_team = MagenticOneGroupChat([web_surfer_agent, video_agent], model_client=model_client,)

    # Run the team and stream messages to the console
    stream = agent_team.run_stream(task="Answer any questions the user asks about video.mp4.")
    await Console(stream)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Using your implementation check if you can answer the following questions:

- What is a high-level two sentence summary of the video?
- What is the motivation behind the project?
- How did they evaluate the success of their approach?

## Whats next?

- You are welcome to continue extending the video surfer for your needs. Add additional actions, or even pair it up with other agents to create an even powerful multi-agent team.
- Share your work! Record screenshots or videos of your video surfer in action and tweet! You may also upload your solution to GitHub! Make sure to use #AutoGen hashtag and tag @pyautogen so that we can discover your work!
