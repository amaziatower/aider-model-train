# Core

```{warning}
This project and documentation is a work in progress. If you have any questions or need help, please reach out to us on GitHub.
```

AutoGen core offers an easy way to quickly build event-driven, distributed, scalable, resilient AI agent systems. Agents are developed by using the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). You can build and run your agent system locally and easily move to a distributed system in the cloud when you are ready.

Key features of AutoGen core include:
