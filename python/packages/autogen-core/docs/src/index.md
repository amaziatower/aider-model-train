# AutoGen

AutoGen is an OSS framework for developing intelligent applications using AI Agents patterns.
It offers an easy way to quickly build event-driven, distributed, scalable, resilient AI agent systems. Agents are developed by using the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). You can build and run your agent system locally and easily move to a distributed system in the cloud when you are ready.

Key features of AutoGen are summarized below.

<!--
Key features of AutoGen include:

- Asynchronous messaging: Agents communicate with each other through asynchronous messages, enabling event-driven and request/response communication models.
- Scalable & Distributed: Enable complex scenarios with networks of agents across org boundaries
- Modular, extensible & highly customizable: E.g. custom agents, memory as a service, tools registry, model library
- x-lang support: Python & Dotnet interoperating agents today, others coming soon
- Observable, traceable & debuggable -->
