    "There are several use cases where it is valuable to maintain a _store_ of useful facts that can be intelligently added to the context of the agent just before a specific step. The typically use case here is a RAG pattern where a query is used to retrieve relevant information from a database that is then added to the agent's context.\n",

    "AgentChat provides a {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.memory.Memory` protocol that can be extended to provide this functionality.  The key methods are `query`, `transform`,  `add`, `clear`, and `cleanup`. \n",

    "- `query`: retrieve relevant information from the memory store \n",
    "- `transform`: mutate an agent's internal `model_context` by adding the retrieved information (used in the {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent` class) \n",

    "\n",
    "{py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.memory.ListMemory` is provided as an example implementation of the {py:class}`~autogen_agentchat.memory.Memory` protocol. It is a simple list-based memory implementation that uses text similarity matching to retrieve relevant information from the memory store. The similarity score is calculated using the `SequenceMatcher` class from the `difflib` module. The similarity score is calculated between the query text and the content text of each memory entry.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we will use ListMemory to similate a memory bank of user preferences and explore how it might be used in personalizing the agent's responses."
