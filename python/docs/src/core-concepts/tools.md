# Tools

Tools can be used together with agents powered by the OpenAI's ChatCompletion or the Assistant API.
AGNext provides the {py:mod}`agnext.components.tools` module with a suite of built-in
tools and utilities for creating and running custom tools.

See [examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/examples#tool-use-examples)
for how to use the built-in code execution tool and creating custom tools.
