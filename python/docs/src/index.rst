AGNext
------

AGNext is a framework for building multi-agent applications with AI agents.

At a high level, it provides a framework for inter-agent communication and a 
suite of independent components for building and managing agents.
You can implement agents in 
different programming languages and run them on different machines across organizational boundaries.
You can also implement agents using other agent frameworks and run them in AGNext.

To get you started quickly, we offers
`a suite of examples <https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/examples>`_.
