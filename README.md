# AutoGen

AutoGen is an open-source programming framework OSS framework for developing intelligent applications using AI Agents patterns. It offers an easy way to quickly build event-driven, distributed, scalable, resilient AI agent systems.  AutoGen aims to streamline the development and research of agentic AI. It offers features such as agents capable of interacting with each other, facilitates the use of various large language models (LLMs) and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.

You can build and run your agent system locally and easily move to a distributed system in the cloud when you are ready.

> -_*Maintainers (Sept 6th, 2024)*

AutoGen was created out of collaborative [research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research) from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.

## Key Aspects

- Asynchronous messaging: Agents communicate with each other through asynchronous messages, enabling event-driven and request/response communication models.
- Scalable & Distributed: Enable complex scenarios with networks of agents across org boundaries
- Modular, extensible & highly customizable: E.g. custom agents, memory as a service, tools registry, model library
- x-lang support: Python & Dotnet interoperating agents today, others coming soon
- Observable, traceable & debuggable

## Getting Started

The current stable release of autogen is autogen 0.2 You can find it here: *TODO: insert link*

The version you are looking at is a new architecture for autogen 0.5.

We are in the early stages of development for this new architecture, but we are excited to share our progress with you.

We are looking for feedback and contributions to help shape the future of this project.

Your best place to start is the [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agnext).

- [Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/agnext) for the core concepts and Python API references (.NET coming).
- [Python README](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/README.md) for how to develop and test the Python package.
- [Python Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-core/samples) for examples of how to use the Python package and multi-agent patterns.
- [.NET](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/dotnet)
- [.NET Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/dotnet/samples)

## News

:fire: **September 16, 2024**: AutoGen 0.5 is a new architecture for autogen! This new version is in preview release and being developed in the open over the next several weeks as we refine the documentation, samples, and work with our users on evolving this new version. ðŸš€

- Autogen 0.5 represents a rearchitecutre of the system to make it more scalable, resilient, and interoperable across multiple programming languages.
- It is designed to be more modular and extensible, with a focus on enabling a wide range of applications and use cases.
- This redeign features a full .NET SDK and python SDKs, with more languages to come in the future.  Agents may be written in either language and interoperate with one another over a common messaging protocol using the CloudEvents standard.

## Roadmaps

- [AutoGen 0.2] - This is the current stable release of AutoGen. We will continue to accept bug fixes and minor enhancements to this version.  
- [AutoGen 0.5] - This is the first release of the new event-driven architecture. This release is still in preview.  We will be focusing on stability of the interfaces, documentation, tutorials, samples, and a collection of base agents from which you can inherit. We are also working on compatibility interfaces for those familiar with prior versions of AutoGen.
- [future] - We are excited to work with our community to define the future of AutoGen. We are looking for feedback and contributions to help shape the future of this project.Here are some major planned items:
  - [ ] Add support for more languages
  - [ ] Add support for more base agents and patterns
  - [ ] Add compatibility with Bot Framework Activity Protocol
  
## Quickstart

The easiest way to start playing is
1. Click below to use the GitHub Codespace

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/autogen?quickstart=1)

 2. Copy OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample to ./notebook folder, name to OAI_CONFIG_LIST, and set the correct configuration.
 3. Start playing with the notebooks!

*NOTE*: OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample lists GPT-4 as the default model, as this represents our current recommendation, and is known to work well with AutoGen. If you use a model other than GPT-4, you may need to revise various system prompts (especially if using weaker models like GPT-3.5-turbo). Moreover, if you use models other than those hosted by OpenAI or Azure, you may incur additional risks related to alignment and safety. Proceed with caution if updating this default.

## [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation)
### Option 1. Install and Run AutoGen in Docker

Find detailed instructions for users [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/installation/Docker#step-1-install-docker), and for developers [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute#docker-for-development).

### Option 2. Install AutoGen Locally

AutoGen requires **Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

Minimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need.

<!-- For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`blendsearch`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#blendsearch-economical-hyperparameter-optimization-with-blended-search-strategy) option.
```bash
pip install "pyautogen[blendsearch]"
``` -->

Find more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#option-2-install-autogen-locally-using-virtual-environment).

<!-- Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed. -->

Even if you are installing and running AutoGen locally outside of docker, the recommendation and default behavior of agents is to perform [code execution](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ/#code-execution) in docker. Find more instructions and how to change the default behaviour [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#code-execution-with-docker-(default)).
