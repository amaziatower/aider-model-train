# AGNext (Starfleet)

AGNext is a OSS framework for developing intelligent applications using AI Agents patterns.
It offers an easy way to quickly build event-driven, distributed, scalable, resilient AI agent systems. Agents are developed by using the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).

You can build and run your agent system locally and easily move to a distributed system in the cloud when you are ready.

## Key Aspects

- Asynchronous messaging: Agents communicate with each other through asynchronous messages, enabling event-driven and request/response communication models.
- Scalable & Distributed: Enable complex scenarios with networks of agents across org boundaries
- Modular, extensible & highly customizable: E.g. custom agents, memory as a service, tools registry, model library
- x-lang support: Python & Dotnet interoperating agents today, others coming soon
- Observable, traceable & debuggable

## Getting Started

We are in the early stages of development, but we are excited to share our progress with you.
We are looking for feedback and contributions to help shape the future of this project.
Your best place to start is the [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agnext).

- [Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/agnext) for the core concepts and Python API references (.NET coming).
- [Python README](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/README.md) for how to develop and test the Python package.
- [Python Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agnext/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-core/samples) for examples of how to use the Python package and multi-agent patterns.
