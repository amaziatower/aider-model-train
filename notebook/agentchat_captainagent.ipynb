    "In this notebook, we introduce CaptainAgent, an agent enhanced with the capability to call AutoBuild to break down and solve complex tasks. AutoBuild can initiate a nested chat between a group of experts and converse to solve the task. The experts in nested chat can be retrieved from agent library. The agents can be equipped with tools for advanced coding. In addition to agent library, we release a tool library that can assist with advanced tasks.\n",
